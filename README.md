# Sudoker

A simple game with elements of Sudoku and Video Poker.

## Gameplay

A five by five grid is partially filled with playing cards. A dock contains enough cards to fill the rest of the grid. Players place cards from the dock onto the grid such that the total value of all poker hands formed on the grid is maximized.
